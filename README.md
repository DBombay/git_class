Git Class for FROGRAMMERS
========================

This Repo exists solely to teach good GitHub fundamentals. Below are some useful command line instructions:

## Basic Terminology

* Repository (repo) - a directory that manages saved versions of code for collaboration and display
* Remote - the saved files for the code which are stored on GitHub
* Local - your physical computer that you are currently working on
* Branch - a self-contained version of the code. If this were a game like Skyrim, then the save file for Krognar the Obliterator would be the branch of the Skyrim game.
* Commit - saved code states. If this were Skyrim again, then the commit would be Krognar, lvl 2, outside of Whiterun.
* Push - Send code from your local computer to the remote repository
* Pull - downloading code from the remote repository to your local system
* Checkout - switch

## Basic Command Line
* `pwd` print working directory. Shows which folder you're in.
* `cd [PATH]` change directory. Change working directory to the designated **PATH**
    * `cd ..` will go UP one directory in the tree
* `ls` list. List files within your current directory.
* `cat [FILE NAME]` concatenate. A fancy way to say 'read'. This will read the text of the **FILE** you designate.

## Interacting with the Remote Repository
* `git fetch` pulls all available branches from the remote repo and saves them on your computer
* `git pull origin [BRANCH NAME]` pulls a copy of the designated **BRANCH NAME** and attempts to merge it with the branch you are currently working in
* `git clone [REPO ADDRESS]` downloads a repository to your machine
